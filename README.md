# fixedPowers

Nothing too fancy here, just my first time making a C++ 'lib',
it's more of a study for me rather than a useful tool for all you githubers out there.

Although, this might be a pretty useful repo, which basically upgrades the 'pow' function in C++,
adding the ability to work with negative exponents. a feature that the original 'pow' function lacks.

I don't really know why would people use this except for maybe a calulator or something like that, but who knows?
Maybe you'll really need that going and will find a dude on github who emplemented that, who could've thought!

To use the function, download it with the command below. Now, in the same directory as the downloaded files, you can create your own file and include the library.

```
// Your shell
https://github.com/MarkParinov/fixedPowers.git
```

```
// Your own file.cpp
#include "fixedPowers"
```

Anyway, I'll be more than pleasured to see at least one comment if this thing ever finds its user. 

I'll probably make a little math library on C++ if this gets at least one comment or star. Thanks for your time!

P.S. I really shouldn't have written all this for a silly power function in C++. It's 11 pm and I am sitting here,
writing a novel for a C++ power function.
